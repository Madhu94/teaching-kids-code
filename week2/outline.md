# Week 02 - Introduction to programming

## More on coding concepts (45 mins)

1. Review last lesson - what is an algorithm, what is code, what is coding (5)
2. Revisit the block diagram of a computer and explain how the above 
  pseudo code is executed. (10)
  - E.g Let's take the example of area of a rectangle we spoke of in class.
  Map each step to what part of the system(input, output, CPU) does it. 
  1. Get l,b (Input device - ask to name an example?)
  2. l*b (CPU)
  3. print result (Output - ask to name an example?)

Workbook (10 - total discussion)
1. Write algorithm to solve (a*b)+c and map each statement to block of computer that performs it.
2. In (a*b)+c's form, pick out the variables and constants. 
(At this point we can stop and review variables and constants **if** needed)

3. Variables! (10)
Question - Where do you think l,b are stored in the computer?
(Breakdown CPU into Memory and Logic circuits, if not done before)

We programmers need to find a way to tell the computer that we need some space
in memory to store (a*b)+c. These are "variables".

Why do we need variables to store values for computation? 
(In very simplified terms)
- Reusability - To avoid writing a new program for each change in input
- Refer to a value later, and perform computations on it

(For now, it is good to think of variables as boxes from where our program will go get data,
draw boxes in memory while writing algorithm)

**TODO**: Example from morning routine with variables?

Workbook (5 - total discussion)
1. Rewrite same algorithm, but with a step to assign value of a and b.
2. In the given algorithm to compute the area  and perimeter of a square,
identify the variables and constants.


4. Flow Chart. (5)
Let's map each function to a different kind of shape and draw a flow chart with it.

Goal: This might seem redundant, but I feel it may be easier to visualize control flow
in following lessons.


### Learning Goals for week2:
- Write algorithms with more clarity/rigor than in week1
- Some terminology - variables, constants. 
- Identify use of variables 
- Learn to draw flow charts

### Ideas
- We may want to start some kind of evaluation/feedback loop this week
  to find out how the students are learning.
- Add a summary of the week's concepts in the workbook so that students 
  don't need to spend a lot of time taking notes. 
- We can include learning resources from Khanacademy or Code.org and ask the students 
to explore them in the following week. (This will help pave the way for a flipped classroom model later on). We can try to find free resources that can be downloaded and 
stored in the computers so that students without internet connection can access.


### TODO - post Week2, before break ends
We should try to install a few tools in atleast some of the systems in the lab **before** dussera hols end. We don't have a strong wifi/internet.
Some suggestions - 
- [Scratch offline editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/download)
- [Mu Python editor](https://codewith.mu/) vs P5.js (for later lessons)

Goal: The kids should be comfortable using the computer and exploring scratch or playing games.
