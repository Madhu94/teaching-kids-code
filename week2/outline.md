# Week 02 - Introduction to programming

## More on coding concepts (45 mins)
1. Review last week's exercises. (5)
2. More on solving math problems(esp. algebra) with pseudo code 
  Algebra may be a good choice because we can bridge the concept(10) 
  Explain the concept of variables/constants(5)
3. Revisit the block diagram of a computer and explain how the above 
  pseudo code is executed. (10)
  - E.g Let's take the example of area of a rectangle we spoke of in class.
  Map each step to what part of the system(input, output, CPU) does it. 


### (15-20 mins) Visit computer lab
We should try to install a few tools in atleast some of the systems in the lab **before** Saturday's class. We don't have a strong wifi/internet.
Some suggestions - 
- [Scratch offline editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/download)
- [KA Lite](https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/)
- [Mu Python editor](https://codewith.mu/) (for later lessons)

Goal: The kids should be comfortable using the computer and exploring scratch or playing games.


### Learning Goals for week2:
- Write algorithms with more clarity/rigor than in week1
- Some terminology - variables, constants, statements
- Get comfortable with computers


### Ideas
- We may want to start some kind of evaluation/feedback loop this week
  to find out how the students are learning.
- Add a summary of the week's concepts in the workbook so that students 
  don't need to spend a lot of time taking notes. 
- We can include learning resources from Khanacademy or Code.org and ask the students 
to explore them in the following week. (This will help pave the way for a flipped classroom model later on). We can try to find free resources that can be downloaded and 
stored in the computers so that students without internet connection can access.
