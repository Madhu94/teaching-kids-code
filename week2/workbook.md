Week 2:
Variables, Constants, Flow charts

1. Write algorithm to solve (a*b)+c and map each statement to block of computer that performs it.
2. In (a*b)+c's, pick out the variables and constants. 
(At this point we can stop and review variables and constants **if** needed)

3. Rewrite same algorithm, but with a step to assign value of a and b.
4. In the given algorithm to compute the area  and perimeter of a square,
identify the variables and constants.
