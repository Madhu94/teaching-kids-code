# Week 01 - Introduction

### Goals
- Gain insights about the kids,
- Establish context for the program,
- Inspire them, to look forward for the next session

### Survey
- Should be fun to engage in
- Gain insights on prior knowledge, interests, expereinces, behaviour
  #### Questions
  - What comes to your mind when we say "computers" or "technology"?
  - How many of you have used a computer or phone or calculater in the past?
  - Have you ever wondered how they work or thought about building something like them or doing something with them?
  - What do you want to become in your life?
  - We should check if our upcoming expamples and analogies are relavent to the kids or not.

## Morning Routine
Description : An unplugged exercise or metaphor to show the kids what an algorithm or generic code looks like. We can introduce code structure, flow, if statements, loops, through this exercise and keep getting back to this example throughout the course.

Breaking down : 
  get up => brush => shower =>
  breakfast => wait for the right bus (loops/conditionals) => get to class =>
  greet your friends (function concept)

**Other Examples**
- Planning a birthday party for a friend
- Planting a seed and growing a tree

We will encourage students to contribute their own answers of activities that they can break into code.

## History of CS
Description : Walk the kids through the history of computers, to answer questions like
- Why were computers invented?
- How did they evolve over time?

Goal : Establish the context of why computers exist in the first place, but in a very story-like fashion,
with slides/pictures/video.

### Stories Connecting to Why Were Computers Invented 
(We need a wide range of examples here, so that we can alter our examples based on the
results of the survey.)
- Connecting the Moonlanding Story to how computers were helpful in making that possible.
- How computers were used to create animated movies - e.g. Winnie the Pooh, Bugs Bunny, Scooby Doo movies
  were made in the late 70s

### Evolution of Computers (shown in pictures)
- Mainframes (big giant room sized machines)
- Minicomputers (fridge or cupboard size machines)
- Desktop / Laptop (present  day) (Box sixed)
- Tabs/Smartphones (pocket sized)

### Why Do We Need Computers
Differences Between Humans and Computers based on the unplugged exercise
  - Humans need to sleep/take rest, computers don't
  - Humans have limited brain / computation power
  - Humans are not good at multi-tasking
  - Humans are slow, take time to solve problems or create things


### Ideas
- Personally interacting with kids who are not engaging actively, to make them feel comfortable and personally make sure that they are able to learn and progress
- Providing some means to contact us off hours (mail or phone or perhaps through TFI).
- **Talking about code as a superpower, or a tool similar to paint, that can be used to create things**
- Get the students to use a small workbook and a pencil throughout the class, as a way to keep them
  engaged continuously.
