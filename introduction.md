# Week 01 - Introduction

### Goals
- Gain insights about the kids,
- Establish context for the program,
- Inspire them, to look forward for the next session

### Survey
- Should be fun to engage in
- Gain insights on prior knowledge, interests, expereinces, behaviour
#### Questions
- What comes to your mind when we say "computers" or "technology"?
- How many of you have used a computer or phone or calculater in the past?
- Have you ever wondered how they work or thought about building something like them or doing something with them?
- What do you want to become in your life?

- We should check if our upcoming expames and analogies are relavent to the kids or not.

Description : An unplugged exercise to show the kids what an algorithm or generic code looks like

Goal: A metaphor that we can map back to coding.
We can introduce code structure, flow, if statements, loops, through this exercise and keep getting back to this example throughout the course.

For week1, we can stop with using this to introduce the concept of `algorithm`, and maybe
`code` and `programming language`.

*Example#1*
- Breaking down their morning routine of getting up from bed and going to school
What we expect more or less - get up => brush => shower =>
breakfast => wait for the right bus (loops/conditionals) => get to class =>
greet your friends (function concept), etc

*Example#2*
- Planning a birthday party for a friend. <TODO: @Madhu94 add a short description>

*Example#3* (From code.org)
- Planting a seed and growing a tree

We will encourage students to contribute answers and build from that.

(We need a wide range of examples here, so that we can alter our examples based on the
results of the survey.)

### History of CS
Description : Walk the kids through the history of computers, to answer questions like
- Why were computers invented?
- How did they evolve over time?

The goal here is to establish the context of why computers exist in the first place, but in a very story-like fashion,
with slides/pictures/video.

- Analogy between humans solving a problem and computers based on the unplugged exercise.
This transitions naturally to why we need computers in the first place.
- Man had aids to computing - abacus, Pascal's adding machine,etc. They aren't computers
    in that they can't be programmed, they were like tools that helped to make computing
    easier. Human computers.
- Babbage's need for a computer to automate navigation log tables. This design was the
    first programmable computer.
- The design was finally implemented in Mark I to Mark IV
- Colossus at Bletchley Park at World War II
- Minicomputers => PC (present  day) => Tabs/Smartphones


### Analogies (examples of events in the 20th century that were advanced by computers)
Space:
- Connecting the Moonlanding Story to how computers were helpful in making that possible.
Science:
- LHC - Splitting the atom
Film Industry:
- Computers were used to create animated movies - e.g. Winnie the Pooh, Bugs Bunny, Scooby Doo movies
  were made in the late 70s


### Ideas
- Personally interacting with kids who are not engaging actively, to make them feel comfortable and personally make sure that they are able to learn and progress
- Providing some means to contact us off hours (mail or phone or perhaps through TFI).
- Talking about code as a superpower, or a tool similar to paint, that can be used to create things
- Get the students to use a small workbook and a pencil throughout the class, as a way to keep them
  engaged continuously.
