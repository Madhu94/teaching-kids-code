# Week 01 - Introduction 

##Goals 
- Gain insights about the kids, 
- Establish context for the program,
- Inspire them, to look forward for the next session

### Survey 
- Should be fun to engage in
- Gain insights on prior knowledge, interests, expereinces, behaviour
#### Questions
- What comes to your mind when we say "computers" or "technology"?
- How many of you have used a computer or phone or calculater in the past?
- Have you ever wondered how they work or thought about building something like them or doing something with them? 
- What do you want to become in your life? 

- We should check if our upcoming expames and analogies are relavent to the kids or not. 

### Morning Routine 
Description : An unplugged exercise to show the kids what an algorithm or generic code looks like, by breaking down their morning 
routine of getting up from bed and going to school. We can introduce code structure, flow, if statements, loops, through this exercise 

### History of CS 
Description : Walk the kids through the history of computers, to answer questions like "why were they invented", 
"what problems do they solve", "why do we need them", "how did they evolve over time". The goal here is to establish the context of why 
computers exist in the first place, but in a very story-like fashion. 

### Analogies 
- Connecting the Moonlanding Story to how computers were helpful in making that possible

## Ideas
- Personally interacting with kids who are not engaging actively, to make them feel comfortable and personally make sure that 
they are able to learn and progress 
- Talking about code as a superpower, or a tool similar to paint, that can be used to create things
